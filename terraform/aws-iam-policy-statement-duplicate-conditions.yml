    message: |
      Usage of jsonencode() to define policy statements containing conditions with duplicate keys is prone to silent squashing during JSON serialization. While the `terraform plan` output will correctly reflect the end state, it may not match the intent of the configuration author.

      Review the guidance at https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/aws-iam-policy, and consider using the aws_iam_policy_document data source instead.
